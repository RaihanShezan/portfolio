💻 [Visit My Website for Profile, Projects & Contact Information](https://www.raihanshezan.com)

I'm a full stack web developer, experienced in developing medium & large scale websites using SQL, NoSQL or GraphQL backend. For frontend design I use React, Redux, SCSS & Bootstrap along with the usual HTML & CSS.

🔭 I’m currently working on building project that accomodates the supply of excess food from restaurants & festivals to hungry people nearby.

👯 I always look forward to collaborate on projects that makes the lives of poor people better, reduces wastage or builds a healthier planet.
